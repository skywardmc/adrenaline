Adrenaline is a **performance modpack** that tries to keep the game as fast as possible, while still looking great. It is meant to be a sort of "base layer" that you can build on top of to make your own modpacks, or just use by itself. It is designed to have the least mods possible, with the best performance possible. No quality-of-life mods, none of that. Just speed.

Here is a quick video that shows some of the key features, and comparisons between Vanilla.

## ➕ Features
### 🔥 Extreme Optimization!
A lot of the optimization is done by Sodium, but there are also a few other great optimization mods installed, tweaked to give the greatest performance while looking good. It can improve the framerate **up to ten times**! Putting that into perspective, Optifine can only play at around *two times* the framerate.

Using FastLoad, there is instant nether travel and faster world generation.

Most of the time I put into this modpack is the optimization, and it gets **better every week** or two.

### ❌ No QOL Mods!
Many other performance modpacks tend to bundle quality of life mods in them, even when they say it's a performance modpack. This is different. I will **always** stay true to its purpose and **only** include optimization mods. No zoom mods, none of that. That's why I call it a base layer, you can add those extra QOL mods yourself after you install it.

If you want Optifine features, try out my other project called [Additive](https://intergrav.github.io/Additive/). It's built off Adrenaline for **great** performance, while having all the nice features from Optifine like capes and shaders.

### ⏩ Very Quick Updates!
I try to update to newer Minecraft versions as **fast as possible**.

#### 🔃 Auto-Updating
Want to have your MultiMC instance automatically update on launch? Check out the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/intergrav/Adrenaline/releases) to learn more.

### 📦 Can I make a modpack with this?
Yes, *you can*! Feel free to use this in any way you want! If you are making something public with this like a modpack, all I ask for is credit somewhere. You don't **have** to give credit - after all it's just a Minecraft modpack, but I spend lots of time maintaining this and it would help a ton. If you do want to give credit, just put this website in there.

### 💬 How can I provide feedback?
If you want to talk about the pack or have any questions, please use the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/36Tv44cYte)! However, if you are asking for a feature to be added or giving a bug report, use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/intergrav/Adrenaline/issues) instead. Thanks!

## ♻️ Versioning
Modpack versions for older MC versions will try to replicate the latest stable version. This makes it super simple, but older versions may have **less features** as many mods can be missing.

This goes for newer, alpha versions as well. However, they will continue to be updated with multiple alpha stages until it has the same mods as the previous version.

For simplicity, I attempt to follow Minecraft's version naming scheme: **1**.**X**.**Y**.
* **1** is just there. I don't know why, but it is.
* **X** is the release. This means adding/removing mods. These won't be made too often.
* **Y** is the patch for that release. This can be updating mods, changing config files, or any other small fix. These will be made often.

I stop supporting older versions over time, but it isn't mandatory to update as they should still be very stable.

LTS (Long-term support) versions are the last minor release of that Minecraft version's major release. This means that 1.16.5 would be the LTS release, not 1.16-1.16.4. LTS versions will be maintained for roughly a year or two before ending support.
