Adrenaline is a simple **performance modpack** that tries to keep the game as fast as possible, while still looking great. It is meant to be a sort of "base layer" that you can build on top of to make your own modpacks and instances or just use by itself. It is designed to have the least mods possible, with the best performance possible. No quality-of-life mods, just optimization.

## 📥 Installation guide

If you would like to install the modpack, go to this page on [the Additive website](https://additive.intergrav.xyz/downloads) (install instructions are the same). After you install, you can figure out how to tweak things to give greater optimizations in the [post-install](https://github.com/intergrav/Adrenaline/wiki/Post-install) section of the wiki. This includes procedures such as increasing your allocated memory, tweaking your game settings for your device, and some more advanced stuff such as changing your Java runtime and JVM flags.

## 🔥 Performance

Adrenaline can significantly improve the performance of your game by using various optimization mods and configurations. It mainly involves faster startup times and a very high increase in framerates.

I won't compare the performance to other modpacks - mainly because doing accurate benchmarks is quite hard to do with a game like this where there are so many factors to consider. It can also depend on your hardware. I would suggest manually doing a benchmark and see which modpack is best for you.

## ◽ Keeping it simple

Adrenaline is created with the sole purpose of optimizing the game's performance, not to add any extra features. This means that you have full control over what features you want to add when setting up your instance, ensuring that only the necessary mods are installed and running, resulting in a very smooth and optimized experience without any unnecessary distractions.

I do have a modpack called [Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive) that is based on Adrenaline, designed to be an open-source alternative to OptiFine. Feel free to check it out!

## 🛡️ Source-available

At its core, Adrenaline is entirely composed of open-source and source-available mods, ensuring that you can view their source code or contribute to them. We strongly encourage you to show your support for the creators and contributors of these mods, as this project would not be possible without their invaluable work.

Furthermore, the Packwiz project for Adrenaline is also publicly available on our [Git repository](https://github.com/skywardmc/adrenaline). This means that you can easily track and observe every change made to the project, report issues or request new features through our [issue tracker](https://github.com/skywardmc/adrenaline/issues), or effortlessly create your own forks of the project.

## ✅ Compatibility

Adrenaline is designed to be compatible with a wide range of devices, even those with very low specifications. This makes it an accessible option with varying hardware configurations. The pack is compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac. Additionally, Adrenaline is much more compatible with other mods as compared to OptiFine, thanks to its more flexible design and native compatibility with Fabric

## 🔄️ Updates quickly

My goal is to keep Adrenaline up-to-date with the latest Minecraft releases, providing tested builds as soon as possible. Although the maintenance of the pack is solely done by me, I will make every effort to release updates promptly. However, please note that there may be some delays due to my limited time and motivation.

**➡️ Note:** This does not apply to snapshots most of the time. I do not bother as they can sometimes require lots of maintenance and come out too quickly. If I recall correctly, [Simply Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop) sometimes has updates for snapshots, so feel free to check that out if you really need them.

## ⚙️ How it works

Adrenaline utilizes a variety of optimization mods that are designed to work seamlessly together. Some of these mods have been adjusted to provide improved performance beyond their standard settings, and this has proven to be effective.
